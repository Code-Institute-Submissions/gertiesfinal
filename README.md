## Demo

## Aim
My aunt has a bakeshop in the Philippines called **Gerties**. She's running it for over 20 years now and has established her loyal customers. Her son set up a Facebook and Instagram accounts to extend their customer reach. I googled their shop and under Questions and Answers there were 3 questions asking for product price list and delivery.

I'm proposing a website for them so they can reach out to potential new customers and hope to increase audience likes and engagement in their Facebook and Instagram.

## UX
### Research and Strategy
For research, my main basis of information are the following:
1. Gerties' Facebook, Instagram & Tripadvisor accounts. (insert link to screenshot)
2. Google reviews & questions and answers part. (insert link to screenshot)
3. Competitor's facebook account - [@CindysBakeryRestaurant](https://www.facebook.com/CindysBakeryRestaurant/?ref=py_c)

I found out that:
1. Competitor has a website with a high number of followers.
2. Enquiries from Gerties' account are based on pricelists and delivery.

**Scope**

1. External user’s goal: The users are new and existing customers who wants to get promotions, updates and possibly book for delivery or catering.
2. Site owner’s goal: The owner is interested in maintaining existing customers and attracting new customers*.
3. Potential features to include: to showcase product photos, menus, delivery, and information about the company.
4. User goal: make them go to delivery or contact page for enquiry.

**Structure**

I gathered key information that will be used for wireframing. This helped me out in organising and labeling the content efficiently to the users. Click here for your reference.

For wireframing, I used keynote for low-fidelity and Adobe XD for high-fidelity (insert link to screenshots). Adobe XD, helped me when exporting assets to web-friendly sizes.

**UI**

Based on their current logo (refer to this link), the colours are yellow, red and lime green. I wanted to propose a whole new look of Gerties by focusing on the name, toning down the red and limiting the colours to be just red and dark grey for simplicity and clean look.*

1. For fonts, I used open sans, helvetica & sans-serif font for clear & easy readability.*
2. The landing page will have 3 sections - Cakes and Pastries, All day menu & Delivery. Using a 12-col layout, I can maximise the space by applying 2-4col images and texts. 
3. I'm using form for users to send in their enquiries and orders. 
4. Under each sections, there will be 3-col of thumbnail product image and information. Since the user goal to make them go tp delivery and contact page, I will add an 'Order Here' text that links to the contact page. 
5. There will be carousel images to highlight Gerties latest promotions. 
6. I will also add links to their social media accounts. 
7. Instagram feed is also added at the bottom of the website after contacts page. This will help increase followers. 
8. This will be responsive for easy accessibility.

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
